 #IoT Traffic Signal System using Arduino
Project Overview
This project demonstrates a simple traffic signal system using three LEDs — Red, Yellow, and Green — controlled by an Arduino board. It simulates real-world traffic light behavior and is perfect for beginners interested in electronics, Arduino, and IoT concepts.

You can optionally upgrade the system with IoT features using ESP8266/ESP32 and control or monitor it remotely through platforms like Blynk, ThingSpeak, or MQTT.
